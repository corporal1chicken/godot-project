# Godot Project
Just a simple Godot project. No major goals or scope, made for fun.

---
### Commit 1: Initial Commit
Basic version of the game. Includes:
- Main Menu
- Choosing a game (none implemented)

---
### Commit 2: a README.md
As the commit name suggests.

---
### Commit 3: Menu Flow Cleanup
Changed how menus are made so it's easier to add/remove screens. Also rewrote all the logic. No progress made on the games, but it's much easier to do so. UI was also realigned and made to scale properly.

---
### Commit 4: This Stupid README
It didn't update so it made a new commit and that's so annoying.

---
### Commit 5: Implemented actual Rock Paper Scissors
Game is actually playable. Pick a difficulty (easy/medium/hard) and it'll change how long you have to pick your move. AI is simple, just picking a move at random so this'll change to reflect difficulty. Also a score count at the top and round end text (you lose! Y beats X).

---
### Commit 6: Cleaned up game logic for Rock Paper Scissors
Separated logic so it's easier to add or remove stuff. Also added gamemodes though hardcoded. Best of 5, First to 3 and Endless. Can select this from the options screen.
