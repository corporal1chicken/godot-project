# Godot Project
Just a simple Godot project. No major goals or scope, made for fun.

---
### Commit 1: Initial Commit
Basic version of the game. Includes:
- Main Menu
- Choosing a game (none implemented)

---
### Commit 2: a README.md
As the commit name suggests.

---
### Commit 3: Menu Flow Cleanup
Changed how menus are made so it's easier to add/remove screens. Also rewrote all the logic. No progress made on the games, but it's much easier to do so. UI was also realigned and made to scale properly.

---
### Commit 4: This Stupid README
It didn't update so it made a new commit and that's so annoying.
